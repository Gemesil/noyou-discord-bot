# What is it exactly?
An annoying discord bot application that spams no you in chat, it also does tricks.
The default command prefix is "~" but you can change it on the config.json file to your liking.

## Commands
All commands are presented with the default prefix, switch the "~" to your own prefix if you have changed it in the config file.
**~help** - lists commands.

**~lethalmode** - makes the bot reply to itself(full chat spam mode). You can toggle this mode on and off by just using the command again.

**~niceguy** - Instead of replying no u to everything the bot will only reply to whomever says specifically writes "no u". Toggle this mode on and off by just using the command again.

**~say [text]** - the bot will post a message with whatever you write in [text] and will delete the message in which you called the say command to hide your identity.

## Notes
- The bot will not save the state of the togglable modes if you turn it off. Meaning if you set the bot to niceguy mode it won't stay in niceguy mode when you restart it.
