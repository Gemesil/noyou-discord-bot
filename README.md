# What is it exactly?
An annoying discord bot application that spams no you in chat, it also does tricks.
The default command prefix is "~" but you can change it on the config.json file to your liking.

## Commands
**~help** - lists commands.

**~lethalmode** - makes the bot reply to itself(full chat spam mode). You can toggle this mode on and off by just using the command again.

**~niceguy** - Instead of replying no u to everything the bot will only to whomever says specifically writes "no u". Toggle this mode on and off by just using the command again.

**~say [text]** - the bot will say whatever you write in [text] and will delete the message in which you called the say command to hide your identity.

## Notes
- The bot will not save the state of the togglable modes if you turn it off. Meaning if you set the bot to niceguy mode it won't stay in niceguy mode when you restart it.
